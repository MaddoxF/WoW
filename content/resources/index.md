## Information hosted in this site

+ [ATLAS experiment](http://opendata.atlas.cern/release/2020/documentation/atlas/experiment.html): learn about ATLAS: the largest multi-purpose particle detector located at CERN.

+ [13 TeV Open Datasets](http://opendata.atlas.cern/release/2020/documentation/datasets/intro.html): find detailed information about the released 13 TeV proton-proton collision data and simulation samples.

+ [Physics analysis examples](http://opendata.atlas.cern/release/2020/documentation/physics/intro.html): illustration of the examples of physics analysis inspired by and following procedures taken in papers published by the ATLAS Collaboration.

+ [Analysis frameworks](http://opendata.atlas.cern/release/2020/documentation/frameworks/intro.html): discussion of the available analysis frameworks and plotting codes.

+ [Online ROOTbooks](http://opendata.atlas.cern/release/2020/documentation/notebooks/analysis-examples.html): description of the data analysis to be performed directly in a web-browser by integrating the ROOT framework with Jupyter notebooks.

+ [Virtual machine](http://opendata.atlas.cern/release/2020/documentation/vm/index.html): description of the virtual machine, which contains all the information needed to carry out educational analysis of the released datasets.

+ [Data visualisation](http://opendata.atlas.cern/release/2020/documentation/visualization/index.html): introduction to the 13 TeV Open Data visualisation using web-based online histograms.
