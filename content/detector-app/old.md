# Higgs to WW - simulated + real data

This Histogram Analyser includes data. This is shown by the black dots, with error bars.
It also includes minor backgrounds, labelled as 'Other' in purple. Minor backgrounds are required for data to match the total simulation. 'Other' includes **single top** production, ***WZ*** and ***ZZ*** diboson production, ***W*** boson production and $$H \rightarrow ZZ^* \rightarrow \ell^+\ell^-\ell^+\ell^-$$ decay.

* *The histograms can take about 30 seconds to load.*
* *Whilst loading you'll only see the histogram titles.*
* *Once loaded you'll see the histograms appear under their titles.*

Here we will just be looking at the electron-muon channel. We are looking at 66 Higgs candidates (see **Expected Number of Events** histogram above). However, the ***Z*** background is much reduced, so that makes it a good choice.
